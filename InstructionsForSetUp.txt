The instructions are for setting up the project in a new Ubuntu 14.04 VM.
To complete the installation and run the program follow these steps:

1) Open an Ubuntu terminal.

2) First we install git. Use the command in the terminal(type Y if prompted):

$sudo apt-get install git

3)Create a directory in "home" called "ubuntu".

4) Download the project in "ubuntu" folder from GitHub repository using the below command:

$git clone https://github.com/ShruthiKatapally/twitter-analysis

5) Navigate to the folder twitter-analysis/installer:

$cd twitter-analysis/installer

6) Run the bash script RunScript.bash. This script will install the necessary software to run the project(type Y if prompted): 

$sudo bash ./RunScript.bash

7) Now to execute the project enter the below command which is a bundled jar file(if error see step 8).

$java -jar DataModels-Mongo.jar

8) If you face an error try re-installing the default jre.

$sudo apt-get install default-jre

Else, the results will be displayed.

10) For verifying the program open mongo shell and copy-paste the commands that came from the program output.

To start mongo db execute the command: $mongo

11) Also in the mongoDB shell we can see the output result of mapreduce after joining two tables:

>db.reduced.find().pretty()

12) Users with tweets can be found in mostly the last documents withing the collection reduced. The following command can be used to show more results:
>it
