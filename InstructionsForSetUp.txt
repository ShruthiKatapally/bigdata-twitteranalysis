The instructions are for setting up the project in a new Ubuntu 14.04 VM.
To complete the installation and run the program follow these steps:

1) Open an Ubuntu terminal(the current directory should be home).

2) First we install git. Use the command in the terminal(type Y if prompted):
sudo apt-get install git

3) To download the project from GitHub repository use the command:
git clone https://github.com/cloud-class-projects/twitter-analysis.git

4) Change the directory of the terminal to installer:
cd twitter-analysis/installer

5) Run the bash script RunScript.bash. This script will install the necessary software to run the project.  
sudo bash ./RunScript.bash

6) CD to twitter-analysis/BigData folder.
cd .. twitter-analysis/BigData

7) Now to execute the project enter the below command which is a bundled jar file(if error see step 8).
java -jar DataModels-Mongo.jar

8) The installation of java has been particularly weird although I have included the command for it in the bash script it sometimes errors out. If it errors out install java again using the command below.(type Y if prompted) Will take some while.
apt-get install default-jre

8) You can run the below command again & again to check for results and performance variations.
java -jar DataModels-Mongo.jar

9) For verifying the program open mongo shell and copy-paste the commands that came from the program output.
mongo

10) Also in the mongoDB shell we can see the output result of mapreduce after joining two tables:
db.reduced.find().pretty()

11) Users with tweets can be found in mostly the last documents withing the collection reduced. The command can be used to show more results:
it
